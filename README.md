This table should help people make a decision which CI to choose for the project.

### Pricing

All listed CI's provide free plan with some restrictions like "open-source projects only" or "only 1 build node",
but it's enough to configure the build process and check if CI suits or not.

##### Free plans

Choosing a free plan for a project is more suitable for a freelance project.
Usually, some services provide limits on such plans for understandable reasons.

##### Paid plans

CI's have different approaches and different paid plans.
Check every CI pricing information for more details and choose the best option for you.

:warning: *This information can get outdated very quickly as services evolve.* :warning:

What might matter is the starting price for paid plan:

* [Jenkins](https://www.cloudbees.com/products/pricing) - starts with **X$.** (paid version (Cloudbees), no public information)
* [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/plans) - starts with **69$/month.** (1 concurrent build, &infin; projects, &infin; build time)
* [Bitrise](https://www.bitrise.io/pricing) - starts with **50$/month.** (1 concurrent build, &infin; projects, 45 min. max build time)
* [TeamCity](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/buy/#license-type=new-license) - starts with **299$.** (4 concurrent builds, 30 project configurations, &infin; build time)
* [Shippable](https://app.shippable.com/pricing.html) - starts with **25$/month.** (2 concurrent builds, &infin; projects, &infin; build time)
* [Gitlab CI](https://about.gitlab.com/products/) - starts with **15$/month.** (2 concurrent builds, &infin; projects, &infin; build time)
* [Circle CI](https://circleci.com/pricing/) - starts with **39$/month.** (2 concurrent builds, &infin; projects, 500 minutes build time per month)
* [Nevercode.io](https://nevercode.io/pricing/) - starts with **5$/month.** (1 concurrent build, &infin; projects, 90 min. max build time)
* [Drone.io](https://drone.io/pricing) - starts with **25$/month.** (1 concurrent build, 5 private projects, &infin; build time)
* [Buddybuild](https://www.buddybuild.com/pricing/) - starts with **79$/month.** (1 concurrent build, &infin; projects, &infin; build time)

#### Presentation

I gave a talk back in 2016 and this repository was a technical part for it. I am describing there configured CI's
and providing my personal opinion about which CI to choose depending on your needs (in :ru: language ).

It doesn't contain information about ALL existing CI services, but should be a good start.

In few words:
- [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/)/[TeamCity](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/) for complex workflow
- [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/)/[Circle CI](https://circleci.com/) for open-source projects
- [Bitrise.io](https://bitrise.io/) for any workflow

### Fabric/Crashlytics project configuration

In order to upload APK to Crashlytics project should have following configuration:
`${projectDir}/fabric.properties` file with `apiSecret` and `io.fabric.ApiKey` in AndroidManifest.xml([1](https://github.com/vgaidarji/ci-matters/blob/master/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml#L17),
[2](https://github.com/vgaidarji/ci-matters/blob/master/app/build.gradle#L59)) file.
**Both keys should not be uploaded to the repository for security reasons!**

Pass both parameters to your build from command line:

    ./gradlew -PfabricApiKey="YOUR_API_KEY" -PfabricApiSecret="YOUR_API_SECRET" crashlyticsUploadDistributionDebug

or export these keys as environment variables on a build machine
and they will be automatically read from there during the build (no need to pass keys as parameters in this case).

### Coveralls

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/vgaidarji/ci-matters/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/github/vgaidarji/ci-matters)

`Coveralls` provides test coverage information. `COVERALLS_REPO_TOKEN` environment variable should be exported on the build machine.
